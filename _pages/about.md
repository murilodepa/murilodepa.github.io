Thanks for visiting my website! 

Hi! I’m Murilo, nice to meet you!

I’m passionate about software development and currently pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering at UNICAMP. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas (PUC-Campinas) and a postgraduate certificate in Software Engineering from UNICAMP.
I work as a Mid-level Software Developer at the Samsung Institute for Development of Informatics (SiDi), where I contribute to the development and maintenance of both backend and frontend solutions. My work includes cryptographic systems, secure data storage, integration with native browsers, educational and parental control features, as well as AI-powered language processing tools. These solutions are developed in partnership with Samsung for both desktop and mobile platforms, including projects such as Samsung Kids, Samsung Pass, Samsung Internet, and Samsung Language AI.
I have experience with the following programming languages: Java, Spring Boot, Kotlin, Python, C#, JavaScript, React and C++.
In addition to my technical skills, I am familiar with agile development methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban. I am recognized for being proactive, adaptable, creative, and results-oriented, with strong communication and collaboration skills.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy learning new technologies and collaborating with others to create meaningful solutions.

Feel free to explore my site and reach out if you want to connect!
