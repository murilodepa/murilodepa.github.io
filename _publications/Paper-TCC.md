This monograph reports an Undergraduate Project that focused on enabling a personalized service for the customers of a retail clothing store through a software system named Venda Mais. The project aimed to propose a solution to increase sales at the store. For this purpose, the student chose a facial recognition neural network to analyze the faces of customers entering the store, a decision tree algorithm to suggest future purchases, and a matchmaking algorithm to indicate the best salesperson to serve each customer. Python and Java programming languages, Spring Boot and React Native frameworks and two MySQL databases were used to develop the proposed solution. Scrum Solo was the development methodology chosen to manage the project and its assessment was carried out remotely, along with an evaluator specialized in the clothing sector. The study presented the main functionalities of the system, focusing on achieving the project objectives, and obtained a promising result considering the evaluator statement that Venda Mais, as implemented, is a solution that enhances the store sales.

Keywords: Facial recognition; Matchmaking; Decision tree.
